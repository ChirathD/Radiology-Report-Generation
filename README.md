# Orthopantomography Radiology Report Generation and Question Answering Using Multimodal AI and Large Language Models

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our project on Orthopantomography Radiology Report Generation and Question Answering. This project leverages multimodal AI and large language models to assist in the automated analysis and reporting of dental panoramic images.

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our research on using advanced AI techniques to enhance radiology report generation and question answering in the context of dental health. The goal is to assist medical professionals by providing initial assessments and supporting decision-making.

## Features

- **Multimodal AI Integration**: Combining image and textual data for comprehensive analysis.
- **Automated Report Generation**: Initial assessment and report creation for dental panoramic images.
- **Question Answering**: AI-based responses to queries ask in Sinhala Language.

## Data

All the training data can be found in our [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/LexiconShiftInnovations) repository.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you will need google pro subscription


## Limitations and Future Work

- The model currently struggles with the precise identification of conditions such as dental caries, particularly regarding the exact location or tooth number.
- Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, improving annotation quality, and incorporating standard classifications to enhance model accuracy.
